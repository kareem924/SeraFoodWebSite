                    With a large number of attractive points of sale, HUGO BOSS is one of the premium retailers in the fashion industry. Our stores and shops on site thrive of course because of the personal commitment and professional expertise of our employees. That's why we're constantly looking for new applicants who can fire up other people and become great additions to our retail team - from temporary help to store managers. But we're also looking for talented people who are great at pulling the strings behind the scenes.<br /> for example retail operations managers, purchasing agents and those responsible for planning and controlling our merchandise management.
